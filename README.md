# Recipebox
A box, containing recipes.

## TODO
* Figure out how to deal with the styling width; sync two sets of variables between the JS and the SCSS files?
* If just using static numbers defined by the SCSS, no need for the container to try to measure client width; just use the values
* Adjust tests for whatever method you decide on for handling ^^
* Make the editor a pop up/fade in modal
* Work out styles for the app
* Release it, probably
