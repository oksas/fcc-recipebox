# Recipebox
A box, containing recipes.

## TODO
* Remove the margin-top on the display title; add a universal padding top to <recipecontainer> probably
* Make proptypes static on classes
* Adjust styles for width for entire container to ensure proper rendering of the grid etc. (make sure the grid fills the full width or vice-versa)
  * Percentage based on smaller screens, then set on larger, with a max-width?
* Make the editor a pop up/fade in modal
* Work out styles for the app
* Release it, probably
