# Recipebox
A box, containing recipes.

## TODO
* Container's handleSave, handleCancel, and switchModes
* Adjust styles for width for entire container to ensure proper rendering of the grid etc.
  * Percentage based on smaller screens, then set on larger, with a max-width?
* Make the editor a pop up/fade in modal
* Work out styles for the app
* Release it, probably
